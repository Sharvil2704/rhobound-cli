# JSON Schemas of rhobound-mcp

The documents that cross a boundary: between the `rhobound` CLI (the root module, standard library only) and the
`rhobound-mcp` server (the `mcp/` module), which runs the CLI as a subprocess and passes JSON both ways; between CI and
the CLI; and between people and either. Both sides test against these files. They are drafted from
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) and [DATA.md](../DATA.md) and frozen per release; until the first release they
may change, and where a file and those documents disagree the documents say what is meant.

How they are tested: `mcp/internal/schematest` loads this whole folder (references resolved by `$id`, without the
network) and validates the goldens of both modules, the examples and fixtures, and the real output of every CLI
command the server or CI reads, made by a CLI built from this repository on `testdata/mcp/loop`. The server embeds
byte copies of the schemas it serves (`mcp/internal/server/schemas`), and a test there fails when a copy differs from
this folder: after editing one of those files here, copy it there.

## Conventions

- JSON Schema 2020-12. Every file has an `$id` under
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sharvil2704/rhobound-cli/main/docs/mcp/schemas/` and refers to the others by
  relative path, so a validator that loads the whole folder resolves every `$ref` without the network.
- `defs.v1.json` holds the shared definitions of ARCHITECTURE.md 5.4 (`Handle`, `Name`, `Route`, `Code`, `Env`,
  `Range`, `Value`, `ChangeItem`, `MeasuredRef`, `Finding`, `Assumption`, `Refusal`) and the ones the other files add
  (`Digest`, `Label`, `KeptShare`, `Tool`, `Float`, `RuleToken`, ...). Every code matches
  `Code`, `^[a-z]+\.[a-z0-9_]+$`; gate rule tokens (`RuleToken`) are a separate namespace.
- Every object is closed (`additionalProperties: false`, or `unevaluatedProperties: false` where a schema extends
  another) unless its description says otherwise. Three are open on purpose: the policy (unknown keys are ignored and
  listed in `gate.json`), the fit record (only its summary fields are a contract; the rest is the engine's lossless
  mirror of the inference, read only by the CLI that wrote it) and `explain`'s `content`.
- The root of each file validates the document named in its `title`. For an MCP tool, the root is the tool's
  output (the view) and `$defs/input` is its input schema.
- **Server keys.** A view is canonical JSON printed by a CLI twin. The server adds only `prediction_id`, `fit_id`,
  `fit_age_s`, `attempt`, `max_preview_attempts`, `escalate` and `links` (ARCHITECTURE.md 5.5). They are optional
  in every view schema, so one schema validates both the server's `structuredContent` and the twin's output.
- Non-finite floats, where a record may hold them (the fit record), are written as the strings `NaN`, `+Inf` and
  `-Inf` (`Float`).

## Report v2 and its v1 projection

Report v2 is additive over v1: `report.v1.json` keeps the keys of the v1 report in `$defs/base` and `$defs/rowBase`,
and `report.v2.json` extends both. The v1 projection of a v2 report removes every key those two definitions do not
name, at the top level and in each service row, and sets `version` to `rhobound-cli.report/v1`; `capture` is already
the capture name stored in the fit. On one architecture, `predict CAPTURE --patch P --json` and
`predict --fit F --patch P --report v1 --json` print the same bytes (ARCHITECTURE.md 4.1).
