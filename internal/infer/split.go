// splits traffic evenly, which is what a Kubernetes Service does per
// connection; with clients that keep their connections alive (most HTTP and
// gRPC clients) the split is per connection, and a few busy connections can
// hold it uneven for minutes. The busier pod then queues more than an even
// split predicts. Each pod's share of the visits is measured over the window
// and tested against an even random split; when the test rules that out, the
// model is given the measured shares (model.Service.Shares).
