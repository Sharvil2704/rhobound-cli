// Server spans that are not request visits.
//
// A streaming call (a gRPC server stream, a watch, a long poll, a feature-flag
// client that holds a stream open) is one SERVER span that lasts minutes: as long
// as the client stays connected. The model reads a SERVER span as a visit, one
// request that holds a worker, so it would read such a stream as a visit that
// long. In the OpenTelemetry Demo three flagd streams of 600 s each were all
// of flagd's busy time (the other 6,824 visits lasted 0.07 ms at the median),
// which gave flagd a service time of 380 ms and 53% utilization, and the
// callers' mean latencies ten to a thousand times too high, with nothing said.
//
// Such spans reach a capture when it is cut by the time its spans ended or
// covers the whole file a Collector wrote: a stream that began before the
// window is still open in it. A capture cut by the time its traces started
// does not hold them.
//
// A SERVER span is taken to be no visit when it lasts
//   - at least otlp.LongSpan (a second),
//   - at least longVisitShare of the time over which the capture's SERVER spans
//     start (the capture's span; a request that long in a capture that short is
//     not a request of the same service as the rest), and
//   - at least longVisitRatio times the median SERVER span of its service.
//
// When such spans hold longBusyRefuse or more of a service's busy time (the
// sum of its SERVER spans), the capture is refused: its mean time and its
// utilization are theirs. Below that they are in the means as the visits they
// are, and a warning names them.
