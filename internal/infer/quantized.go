// Start times on whole milliseconds.
//
// Some runtimes stamp the start of a span on a whole millisecond (the OpenTelemetry
// JavaScript SDK on Node.js does, for the spans of the HTTP and gRPC instrumentations;
// the end is read from a finer clock). The start of such a span lies up to a
// millisecond before the work began. In the OpenTelemetry Demo, 100% of the starts
// of every span of the front end and the payment service (Node.js) are whole
// milliseconds, against 0.0 to 0.3% of those of the other services (a clock of
// microseconds would give 0.1%).
//
// For a caller that stamps its CLIENT spans so, calls that follow one another
// within a millisecond are read as made at once: the second call starts 1.6 ms after
// the first began (1.2 ms after the first ended), but both are stamped to the
// millisecond they fall in, and the second is stamped before the first has ended. In
// the Demo that made "cart, then cart" of the front end's POST /api/cart (967 of
// 1731 visits) and the recommendation lookup that precedes four catalogue lookups
// (256 of 794) read as calls at once, and so the front end's call shapes wrong
// (the callee's load is exact whatever the shape). The callee's SERVER span,
// stamped by a finer clock, tells the order: a call is placed where its callee's span
// is, and two calls are in one stage unless the callee spans leave a gap between them
// of at least quantGap of the round trip's overhead (the client span's time less the
// server span's, the time on the wire and in the client library, averaged over the
// two calls). One call's return and the next call's send fall in that gap when the
// second starts after the first has ended; calls made at once leave less.
//
// The test needs the callee's span, so a call without one is placed by its own start,
// and the pods that stamp on whole milliseconds are found from their own spans: a pod
// whose spans start on whole milliseconds in at least quantShare of them (and at
// least quantMinSpans of them) is one. The end of such a caller's span can come before the end of its last CLIENT
// span, so a call that ends after the span is allowed a millisecond (notWaited) before it is taken for one that
// was not waited for.
