// Nested spans of one kind in one pod.
//
// Some frameworks open a second span of the same kind inside the span of the
// HTTP or RPC instrumentation, in the same process, for one and the same unit
// of work: Next.js opens a SERVER span for its request handler inside the HTTP
// instrumentation's SERVER span; flagd's flag-evaluation handler opens a
// SERVER span inside the Connect RPC interceptor's; .NET's gRPC client opens a
// CLIENT span around the HTTP client's CLIENT span. Read as they stand, the
// first two are a service calling itself (a cycle in the call graph, and every
// request counted as two visits, the first of which releases its worker at
// once), and the third is one call counted twice: the outer CLIENT span has no
// SERVER span under it, so it is an unmatched call to an address that does
// answer, and the trace is counted as having lost a span.
//
// A span is nested in another when
//   - it is a SERVER (or CLIENT) span and the nearest SERVER or CLIENT span
//     above it, found as ownership is (ancestor: through INTERNAL and PRODUCER
//     spans, ending at a CONSUMER span), is of the same kind;
//   - both were emitted by one pod of one service (same service name and pod
//     identity: k8s.pod.name, else service.instance.id, else host.name);
//   - the inner span starts within the outer's time and does not end later
//     than nestedSlackNs after it; and
//   - for SERVER spans, they are not from one named instrumentation scope.
//     A framework's span inside the HTTP or RPC instrumentation's comes from
//     another library (in the data seen: the HTTP instrumentation and next.js;
//     the Connect interceptor and flagd's handler), where a service that sends
//     a request to itself with a client that opens no span would show two
//     SERVER spans of one scope. That is a call, and it is left as one. A span
//     that names no scope is judged on the other conditions.
//
// Of two nested SERVER spans the inner is made INTERNAL: the outer is the one
// the caller's CLIENT span (or the caller's own span) is the parent of, it
// starts when the request reached the process and ends when the response left
// it. Of two nested CLIENT spans the one the callee's SERVER span is under is the
// call (in the data seen, the inner of 559 of 559), and the wrapper is made
// INTERNAL; a wrapper is never kept over a span with a SERVER span under it, and
// two CLIENT spans that each have one are two calls. When the wrapper wraps
// several (retries, a token fetch and then the call), each of those with a
// SERVER span under it is a call that reached the wire, and a span with none
// under it, below a wrapper that has one, is not another call. When no span
// of the nested CLIENT spans has a SERVER span under it (a call to a database
// or a service that sends no spans), the outermost is kept: it is the operation the
// caller waited for, and what is nested in it (a connect, an attempt) is part
// of it. A kept CLIENT span with no peer takes the peer and port of the nearest
// span of its nest that has one. What is under a demoted span is still under the
// kept one, as INTERNAL spans are walked through, so no work is lost: the kept
// span's time covers it. A parent cycle in malformed data (a span that is its
// own parent), or a chain of more than maxNestedDepth spans, is not nesting:
// such a chain is left alone.
//
// What is not merged: a SERVER span below a CLIENT span below a SERVER span of
// the same service, in this pod or another (a call to itself over the
// network: the CLIENT span stands between, so the nearest span above is not of
// the same kind), a SERVER span below a SERVER span of another pod of the
// same service (a call to a replica), and CONSUMER and PRODUCER spans (a
// consumer's "receive" and "process" spans are a hand-off, not a wrapper: the
// process span starts after the receive span has done most of its work). The
// pod is the identity the capture gives: a capture whose resources name no pod,
// instance or host has one pod per service.
//
// The time test cannot be strict containment. Node.js (and nginx) spans carry
// start times on whole milliseconds, so two spans of one process are placed up
// to a millisecond apart from where they were: in the 16,824 Next.js pairs of
// the OpenTelemetry Demo (two captures) the inner span starts 0 to 3 ms after the
// outer one, and 17 to 22% of them end after it, by up to 0.89 ms. The slack is
// twice that clock's resolution, so that a pair at the edge of it is still merged
// (one pair left unmerged would leave a service calling itself, and the whole
// capture refused); an inner span that starts or ends more than that after the
// outer span's end is work that outlives the request, which is not merged.
