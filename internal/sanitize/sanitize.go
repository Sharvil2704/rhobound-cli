// Package sanitize is the one rule every string from a trace passes before it reaches an agent
// (docs/mcp/ARCHITECTURE.md 5.9). Service names, peer names and routes come from traces, and some of them are set by
// anonymous end users (a request path, a peer address), so a view never prints one as it was read:
//
//   - a name of at most 128 characters from [A-Za-z0-9._:/@-] is kept; anything else becomes svc_ and the first 8 hex
//     digits of its sha256, marked untrusted (contract.SafeName, the rule check's findings use too), and so does a
//     name in which ext: starts a word anywhere but at its start (a route such as /status/ext:x): ext: stands only for
//     the model's node of a peer;
//   - an AWS resource name (arn:partition:service:region:account:resource) is shown as its last element, untrusted
//     (for an ECS task, its id), unless that holds an account (the ARN's own account field anywhere, or 12 digits in
//     a row, as written or with its "-" taken out), and any other name that holds arn: (after a character that is
//     not a letter or a digit, or before a partition: contract.NamesARN) is hashed: an ARN names an account. The rule
//     sees what it is given: an ECS task's id that the reader kept is a name like any other;
//   - a peer the capture does not know as a service (the model's ext:<peer> nodes) becomes external_ and the first 8
//     hex digits of the peer's sha256, so that an address never appears, even one the name rule would keep;
//   - a route, only from http.route or rpc.method, may be an upper-case method, one space and a template from
//     [A-Za-z0-9._:/@{}*-] (POST /orders/{id}), in which ext: starts no word and that holds no arn:; anything else is
//     hashed as a name is.
//
// Raw url.path, http.target, http.url and server.address values are never read by the views at all.
