// TestServerCanariesNeverLeak: no trace value that ARCHITECTURE.md 5.9 keeps from a caller, and no folder, reaches any
// reply. The canary captures (gencontract canaries, from internal/testgen) plant each such value as a unique string:
// peers no service answers, under every peer key, with and without a port, called a varying number of times,
// fire-and-forget, and at once on some visits (call shapes); a known callee's address on the CLIENT spans of the 2.5%
// of traces that lost its spans (admitted with doubts) and of 12.5% (refused); a peer renamed by a cluster dump; an A/B
// pair whose calls name a peer; raw request paths; an image name that is a registry's URI, with its tag; an http.route
// of probe-like entries in which ext: starts a word; ECS task ARNs as the pod identity, with their account and cluster,
// and the other ARNs of an ECS resource; container ARNs as service.instance.id, and an ARN after "task_" as one; a
// service whose name the name rule hashes, which every reply must name as the views do; a service named as the model
// names a stage node (stage:S:1), on the path to the changed service, which the biased constructs pass through;
// services named so that a name runs across the words of a call shape (w then ext: before a peer, w then q before a
// service whose name the rule hashes); and a trace id that is text, not an id, on spans the reader skips. Their table, with the folders laid out here (the server's own, and those of
// baselines fitted outside the server without --name, from a folder and from a cut's manifest) and the canaries of the
// records shaped by hand below, is the forbidden list: a canary added to the table is looked for everywhere. Before the
// sweep, each canary is shown to be where the engine's output (or, for what the reader drops or the name rule hashes,
// the traces) holds it, and what the engine shows in its place to be there, so that the sweep looks for something that
// is there.
//
// Each baseline (every capture fitted outside the server from its folder with --name; the capture with peers also from
// a cut's manifest with --name, as DEPLOY_AWS.md 14 says, and from a folder and that manifest without it; and the ECS
// capture's record as an engine without the reader's task-id rule wrote it, with the whole ARN) is swept through every
// read-scope surface (views: context, budget, predict, explain on the fit and the prediction, the fit, prediction and
// judge-packet resources, the prompts, job_status and the refusals), in both profiles, both protocol revisions and both
// transports (in memory as in stdio mode, and HTTP with a read-only token). Fits made by the server are swept in stdio
// mode (fit_start, and context{capture} in the bench profile), with the refusals of a fit job; the A/B surfaces
// (predict with a measured A/B, explain on its handle, a refused A/B job) in stdio mode and over HTTP with a fit token,
// since only the caller who made an A/B record can use it.
//
// Records shaped by hand (canary_records_test.go), since a stored record is not trusted to be the configured engine's:
// a fit record with every string field holding a canary of its own, as tokens and as ARNs, stored as the baseline,
// which the engine refuses as a record its version did not write (fit.version), and so the engine's record
// re-serialized; one for each node-name field of its inference mirror (a varying call's callee, a word of a call shape,
// a node's name in the model, the caller a stage node names) holding a name that is not one of its rows, which it
// refuses so too; one with only the names its checks cannot judge planted (among them the subject of a doubt the
// default policy holds, which the gate's rule 5 names, ARNs whose last element holds their account, also in its dashed
// form, and a merged nested span's service, which may name a service that is not a row), and two whose capture is an
// ARN that holds its account (alone, and after a folder), which it reads; all swept in both profiles and both
// transports, on every read surface whatever context with env answered (through handles minted on the record as before
// an engine upgrade), each surface refusing a record the engine refuses with fit.version. In stdio mode: A/B records
// with every field planted, stored and minted for the caller, and one with only its names planted; job records with a
// planted refusal and findings; prediction records with a planted policy name and clock; and job records in a Dir store
// whose files were rewritten after they were stored (a planted state, step, result and id, and a file that is not
// JSON), read by job_status and, for the id, by fit_start repeating a request.
//
// No reply, error message or error data may carry a canary, the model's ext: prefix, an AWS ARN, or a folder; and none
// may be an internal error, such as a document the server would not serve, so that no planted string can stop a
// surface answering.
