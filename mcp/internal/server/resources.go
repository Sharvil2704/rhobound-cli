// whole: they are the CLI's projections, which apply these rules themselves, and the server passes them on as the CLI
// printed them, byte for byte their twins'. served rewrites doc in place, wherever in it these are:
//
//   - a model node of a peer that no service of the capture answers, ext:<peer> (the name of a services[] row: every
//     row marked external has one), and ext:unknown, becomes external_<first 8 hex of the peer's sha256>, as the CLI's
//     views print it (sanitize.Service). It is replaced in every string, object keys included, whole or in part where
//     ext: starts a word and the name ends (nodeEnds), the longest name first, so that a peer's name is never
//     rewritten inside a longer one's, and a longer name is never half hidden;
//   - any other string or key in which ext: starts a word, a peer node no row names or trace text such as a route, is
//     replaced whole by svc_<first 8 hex of its sha256>, as the name rule hashes a name it does not keep
//     (contract.SafeName): nothing of it is served, and no string can stop a document being served;
//   - every other row's name that the views show by another name (a name the name rule does not keep, such as one
//     with a space, text outside ASCII or over 128 characters, as svc_<hash8> of it; an ARN as the rule shows one; a
//     row named by an ARN whose last element another row is shown by as svc_<hash8> of the whole name, so that no two
//     rows share a name: viewName and oneToOne, the views' rule) becomes that name wherever a string or key is that
//     name, so that the document names each node as the views do, and by a name a caller can give a tool;
//   - a call shape (call_shapes[].shape) is read word by word as the inference writes one, each word a row's name,
//     and each word is shown as the views show its row; a shape that does not read so in exactly one way is hashed
//     whole (shape), so that a name that runs across the words of a shape never takes another word's name with it;
//   - the service of a merged nested span (nested_spans_merged[].service) that is not a row, a service of the capture
//     that emits no SERVER span and so is no node of the model, becomes the name the views would show it by alone
//     (viewName): the record's checks hold every node it names to be a row, but not these (fit.Record.Check); and so
//     does any other node name outside the rows (busiest_service, a biased construct's service, an asynchronous
//     call's caller and callee, a varying call's callee) that names no row, as the engine never writes one
//     (notNodes);
//   - then an AWS resource name (arn:partition:service:region:account:resource), which names an account, becomes its
//     last element unless that holds an account, and any other string or key that holds arn: is hashed whole, as the
//     name rule shows them (arnShown): a stored record is not trusted to be the current engine's, whose reader keeps
//     an ECS task's id;
//   - a key rewritten to one the object already has keeps its value under the name rule's hash of it (freeKey);
//   - each example of trace.peer_renamed, a raw server.address:port, becomes external_<hash8> of it (hidePeers);
//   - a finding's subject that starts with /, and an example that does (but trace.probe_like_traffic's, which are
//     routes), are left out, as the views leave them out (unrooted);
//   - a capture is shown as explain's fit summary shows it (captureName);
//   - image names (container.image.name and its tag) are left out, with every images key (today a row's): on a
//     registry such as ECR they name the account, the region and the repositories;
//   - warnings are left out: they are free text, and a lost-span warning prints a callee's server.address:port, which
//     no row of the report names, so the server cannot rewrite them safely.
//
// It returns how many warnings it left out, and whether it changed anything: a document it leaves alone is served as
// the engine printed it (a judge answer cites the sha256 of the packet's bytes).
