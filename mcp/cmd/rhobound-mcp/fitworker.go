// function for fit_start and by the scheduler. Each event is one job; it runs in a fresh folder under /tmp that is
// removed at the end, and any failure (an error, a panic, the job's deadline_at) is written to the state store as
// failed before the invocation ends (lambdart.Job).

// environment's name and no folder (or `rhobound diff-fit` with the arms' names for an A/B job), and records the
// result; Fail writes the job as failed with its refusal. The server's wiring sets it; while it is nil, the worker
// reports an init error.
